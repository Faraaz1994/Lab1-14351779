# Simple Calculator
I have created a simple calculator using ReactJS and ExpressJS.

### Prerequisites
react : 16.9.0
express: 4.16.1

### How to use
The calculator performs simple calculations. It does not support chaining of operation.

Enter the first operand then choose the desired operator and then enter the second operand.
Click "=" button to view result.
